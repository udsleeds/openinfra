Title:
Open data and tools for accessibility analysis

Abstract:

Accessibility is key for increasing the uptake of sustainable transport modes. Open data, such as OpenStreetMap data, and tools, such as ActDev and Wheelmap, have the potential to improve local understanding and analysis of accessibility to public spaces. The talk will highlight how the use of open data and tools can encourage the participation, and diversification of, local communities in transport planning.
